
1. As a developer, I will learn about cross-browser compatibility to ensure the application works seamlessly on various web browsers.

	There are many different issues that can cause compatibility issues between browsers. Here are a few common issues I found
	The lack of HTML/CSS validation. Browsers can interpret HTML/CSS differently and have different assumptions, so it is helpful to use tools that help validate that your code will work on different browsers
	Not using CSS resets. The CSS styling for each browser is different so if it is not reset then each browser will render the website differently
	Using browser version dection instead of feature detection. This approach was used in the past so for modern browsers it may cause code to malfunction

	I didnâ€™t see any special requirements for security browsers.
