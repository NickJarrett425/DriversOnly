2. As a developer, I will learn about implementing firewalls, so that I can protect against cyberattacks.
Key Concepts:
Firewall Purpose: Firewalls are network security devices or software that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as a gatekeeper, deciding which traffic is allowed and which is blocked.
Types of Firewalls:
Packet Filtering Firewalls: Examines packets of data and makes decisions based on predefined rules (e.g., IP addresses, port numbers).
Stateful Inspection Firewalls: Keeps track of the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of the traffic.
Proxy Firewalls: Acts as an intermediary between the internal network and external network, forwarding requests on behalf of clients.
Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW): Combines traditional firewall capabilities with additional features like intrusion detection and application-level filtering.
Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):
 These are often integrated with firewalls to provide real-time monitoring and protection against suspicious or malicious activities


BEST PRACTISES FOR IMPLEMENTING FIREWALLS - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/small-business/resource-center/security/how-to-setup-a-firewall.html#~configuration-guide

Default Deny Policy: 
Set a default policy that denies all traffic and only allows what is explicitly needed. This principle follows the concept of the "principle of least privilege."
Regular Updates: 
Keep your firewall software and rule sets up to date to protect against emerging threats.
Segmentation: 
Divide your network into segments and apply firewalls strategically to control traffic between them, limiting lateral movement for attackers.
Logging and Monitoring: 
Enable logging to track and analyze firewall events. Implement real-time monitoring to respond to potential threats promptly.
Access Control Lists (ACLs): 
Use ACLs to define and enforce firewall rules. Regularly review and audit ACLs to ensure they align with security policies.
Testing and Validation: 
Test firewall rules and configurations in a controlled environment before deploying them to the production network.
