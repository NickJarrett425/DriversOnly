What is Data Migration?
    Data migration is the process of moving information, whether that be transferring information to a 
    different location, file format, environment, storage system, database, datacenter, or application.
    The format of the data may remain the same.
    The process consists of planning, implementation, and validation.
Data migration in regards to databases:
    This type of data migration typically involves moving large amounts of data to an updated or different database engine or database management system (DBMS)
    May be necessary when organizations need to upgrade their database software, migrate a database to the cloud, or change database vendors
Data migration in relation to website code:
    Application migration involves moving data to a new computing environment.
    This type of migration may require both database and storage migrations
    Application migrations may occur when there is a change in:
        the software an organization uses
        the vendor that provides the software
        the platform where the software resides
In my opinion, I do not think that we need to do any data migration; however, maybe we will in the future if we decide to switch to a different 
kind of DBMS like DynamoDB or Amazon Aurora. Since we will then need to migrate the data we have over to that new database.
If we do decide to do a migration we may want to use tools like:
    AWS Database Migration Service
    Amazon EMR (fka Amazon Elastic MapReduce), Amazon Kinesis, and Lambda with custom scripts
