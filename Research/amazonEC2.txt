Amazon EC2 is a cloud service for launching virtual servers known as instances. To create one:

Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) as a template.

Options include AWS-provided AMIs, your custom AMIs, third-party templates, and community-shared AMIs.
Select an instance type based on your needs.

Consider factors like memory, CPU power, storage, and network performance.
Instance types have names like "t2.micro."
Specify network settings, including VPC, subnet, and public IP assignment.

Optionally attach an IAM role for AWS service interactions.

Optionally use a user data script to customize your instance's environment.

Configure storage, defining root volume and optional additional volumes.

Add tags for metadata, aiding in management and cost allocation.

Set security group rules to control instance traffic.

Identify or create a key pair for secure access, especially for Windows AMIs.

Launch your instance via AWS CLI, AWS Console, etc.
