	SQL injection can be prevented with multiple techniques. For best practices bellow should be used at a minimum. 
	Using prepared SQL statements. This is helpful because if a sql injection does happen the attacker will not be able to change the intent of the query just the data the query is searching for. 
	Use stored procedures in the SQL database. This is helpful for a similar reason as SQL statements. If a attacker can take over a query if the query uses a stored procedure it can help cleanse input and make sure queries are doing what they were intended to do
