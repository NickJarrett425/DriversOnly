Admin Interface
  Django provides a built-in admin interface for 
  managing data in your application. 
  This admin interface is highly customizable and can save 
  a significant amount of development time when building 
  content management systems or other data-driven web 
  applications.

Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture
    Django's architecture is based on the MVC pattern, where 
    the Model represents the data structure, the View handles
    presentation and user interface logic, and the Controller
    (or in Django's case, the URL dispatcher) manages the 
    flow of requests and responses.
