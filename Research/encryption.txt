What is encryption?
    Data encryption is a way of translating data from plaintext to ciphertext
    Users can access their encrypted data with an encryption key and decrypted data with a decryption key
    Encryption works by securing transmitted digital data on the cloud and computer systems
    The two kinds of data:
        Transmitted data
        Data-in-Transit
    Asymmetric encryption (aka Public-Key Cryptography)
        Encrypts and decrypts data using two separate cryptographic asymmetric keys. These keys are known as the “public key” and “private key”.
        Common asymmetric encryption methods:
            RSA
            Public key infrastructure (PKI)
    Symmetric encryption:
        Is a type of encryption where only one secret symmetric key is used to encrypt the plaintext and decrypt the ciphertext.
        Common symmetric encryption methods:
            Data Encryption Standards (DES)
            Triple DES
            Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
            Twofish
How can we use it to protect user data?
    Cloud service providers may be responsible for security of the cloud, but customers are responsible for security within the cloud.
    With the sensitive information being stored in our system, we can encrypt our data to defend against brute-force and cyber attacks.

What are some different tools and techniques that we can use to encrypt data?
