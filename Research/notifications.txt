How can we do it ?

AWS SNS - Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers (also known as producers and consumers). AWS SNS is a fully managed messaging service that supports SMS, email, and push notifications.It can be used to send real-time notifications to users and administrators based on various triggers. SNS is a suitable choice for sending alerts, updates, and notifications to users and admins.

Django Email Backend - Django provides an email backend that supports various email providers, including SMTP, SendGrid, and more. This can be used to configure email settings within Django for sending registration emails and other notifications.

Push Notifications: - Consider integrating a push notification service like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for sending real-time updates to mobile app users. FCM can be used to notify drivers about points earned, product redemption opportunities, and sponsor messages if a mobile app is part of the project.
