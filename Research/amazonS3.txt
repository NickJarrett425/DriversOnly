Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3):
	Data is stored as objects in buckets
	Virtually unlimited storage (up to 5TB per object)
	Designed for 11 9s of durability
		Designed to have at least 99.999999999% annual durability. So if you stored 1 billion objects, you could probably go 100 years without losing a single one.
	Granular access to buckets and objects
Access through HTTP or HTTPS provides low-latency access to buckets; in addition, you can also access S3 through a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) endpoint.
Object-level storage classes:
	S3 standard - is designed for high durability, availability, and performance object storage for frequently accessed data
	S3 Intelligent-Tiering - designed to optimize costs by moving data to the most cost-effective access tier
	S3 Standard-Infrequent Access - used for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed
	S3 Glacier - is a secure, durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving
	S3 Glacier Deep Archive - lowest-cost storage class for S3. It supports long-term retention and digital preservation that might be accessed once or twice a year.
